title: Will you hire this guy?

Look at this code:

{% gist 5722a0b4711c5e178324407bd919b5dd %}

It's awful. He doesn't know basics. `goto` statement in C? At least it can be simplified. This code smells! He probably should go and work for Starbucks.

Author of this code is Linus Torvalds. This world is not perfect and your judging based on small peice of code just doesn't work.
