Hi,

I’m Roman, the guy behind this blog and a true geek.

I consider myself a pioneer of a new generation of geeks, you may call it Geek 2.0. On the one hand I retain the basics of being a geek i.e. being good in science, treating my PC as member of my family, reading lots of stuff on a daily basis, and using vim for about 4 years now (mostly because I can't figure out how to exit it).

On the other hand I am good in sports, hold PhD equivalent degrees in several video games, love Amsterdam and have a blessing to always find myself among the smartest people around.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computational Science. If you would like to know me better, feel free to add me to your friends on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/romanpushkin).
